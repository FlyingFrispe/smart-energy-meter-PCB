# smart-energy-meter-PCB
this is my graduation project in which we tried to dessign and print a ingle phase energy smart energy meter that measures voltage, current, power, and energy
we used the STM32F1 as our MCU, and the ATMEL M90E26 as our metering chip.
it has an LCD scrren to dissplay the results and a wifi capabillity to send and view the data on a website.
you can also control wheather you can connect or disconnect the connected loads through the website.
this project includes the PCB, schematic, and library file used to design the smart energy meter.
